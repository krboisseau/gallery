This image gallery takes images from one folder and resizes them using the GD2
library for PHP to create thumbnails. The code was taken from a tutorial on a 
site. I modified it based on comments on that article and some of my own work 
to function with Colorbox to display the images in a pop up window. I put this 
together in an afternoon for a friend to use on their site.

To be clear, most of this code is not mine, or is only slightly modified by me.
What I mostly did was find existing code that did what I wanted and modified it
for my specific needs.
